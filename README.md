# openssl_server_client
An implementation of a simple server/client model with openssl to secure the channel.

For server.c and client.c, a default port # has already been setup. The default host for client.c is also set to be "localhost". So it can be run just by "./client" and "./server" without further arguments when doing the testing and demo.
